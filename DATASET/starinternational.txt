How do you get a rate?
Rate depends on the tonnage and route and is open for discussion with other colleagues. 

Please contact us on the given phone number to get an exact rate based on your requirements. 
We carry loads to specified destination by the customer. Loads means anything the customer wants carried e.g. grain, minerals etc. When a customer
has loads they want us to carry, we thank them profusely then we ask from them information such as what do they need transported, what is their route i.e. where do they want it transported, the times they need it transported such as expected delivery date
expected loading date, number and type of trucks needed and the rate they are offering for these loads to be carried. After the customer gives us this information, we get back to them with the expected answer. If the load is 1-10 tonnes we will automatically accept a rate of $1500 USD per tonne.
If less, we will persuade them to increase to at least 1400 per tonne. If not, we will promise to get back to them. If a cutomer does not have a load to be 
carried, we will thank them and ask them when they think they will have a load for us. We will promise to check on them at the promised date. 

For new customers we offer to schedule an appointment to discuss further, and encourage everyone to visit our website
